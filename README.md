# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of Bikesharing Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to better understand bikesharing programs to make a case for bringing a bikesharing program to Des Moines, IA.  This analysis is based on bikesharing data from NYC's bikesharing program.

### Checkout Times for Users
![Checkout Times for Users](https://github.com/rabascoh/bikesharing-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Checkout_Times_for_Users.png)
Almost all trips are under 1 hour with most trips falling under 30 minutes. 

### Checkout Times by Gender
![Checkout Times by Gender](https://github.com/rabascoh/bikesharing-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Checkout_Times_by_Gender.png)
Most trips fall under 1 hour for all genders. 

### Trips by Weekday
![Trips by Weekday](https://github.com/rabascoh/bikesharing-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Trips_by_Weekday.png)
Most trips fall within normal commuting hours (8-9am & 5-6pm) during weekdays. Weekends have higher usage from late morning to early evening. 

### Trips by Gender
![Trips by Gender](https://github.com/rabascoh/bikesharing-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Trips_by_Gender.png)
Men have the highest concentration of trips during commuting hours. There is still a slight increase for commuting hours for women, however there is no relationship between commuting hours and usage for those without gender information. 

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/rabascoh/bikesharing-analysis/blob/main/Resources/User_Trips_by_Gender_by_Weekday.png)
Male subscribers appear to be driving the weekday concentration with most rides occuring on Mondays/Tuesdays and Thursdays/Fridays. There is also a slight increase in usage during weekdays for female subscribers. No other groups show an increase during weekdays.  

## Summary
If the Des Moines bikesharing program reflects the trends found in NYC, we would expect most users to take trips under 1 hour during commuting hours. For users of the bikesharing program, we would expect a predominantly male, subscriber user base. 

### Additional Analysis
In order to better understand usage, we recommend the following visualizations. 
1. **Checkout Times by User Type** | We recommend creating an additional line chart to explore trip durations by user type to see if there are differences in trip length between customers and subscribers. 
2. **Trips by User Type (Weekday per Hour)** | We recommend creating an additional heat map to explore trips by user type to determine whether there are certain times of the day that subscribers are more active than customers.
