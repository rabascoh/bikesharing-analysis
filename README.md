## Summary
If the Des Moines bikesharing program reflects the trends found in NYC, we would expect most users to take trips under 1 hour during commuting hours. For users of the bikesharing program, we would expect a predominantly male, subscriber user base. 

### Additional Analysis
In order to better understand usage, we would recommend the following visualizations. 
1. **Checkout Times by User Type** | We recommend creating an additional line chart to explore trip durations by user type to see if there are differences in trip length between customers and subscribers. 
2. **Trips by User Type (Weekday per Hour)** | We recommend creating an additional heat map to explore trips by user type to determine whether there are certain times of the day that subscribers are more active than customers.
